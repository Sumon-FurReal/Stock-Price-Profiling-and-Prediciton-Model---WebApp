Stock Prices Profiling and Prediction

This applicaiton allows you to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) and predict stock price
This project aims to profile and predict stock prices using a linear regression model. 

The model takes into consideration the following variables:

High: The highest price of the stock for the given day
Low: The lowest price of the stock for the given day
Open: The opening price of the stock for the given day
Close: The closing price of the stock for the given day
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of the stock for the given day
Vol: The volume of the stock traded for the given day

The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and trends in the stock prices data.

Requirements :-
Python 3.6 or higher
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Streamlit

Model :-
The model uses linear regression to predict the future stock prices based on the historical data. The coefficients and the intercept of the linear regression equation are calculated using the scikit-learn library.

Note :-
The predictions made by the model are based on the historical data, and any future fluctuations in the stock market cannot be predicted with certainty. Use the predictions made by the model for informational purposes only and not for any financial or investment decisions. Additionally, the EDA is a tool to understand the data and any patterns, but it does not indicate causality.
